=head1 NAME

RTFM::Extension::ArticleTemplates - turns articles into dynamic templates.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This extension works with RT 3.8 and RTFM. If you are using RT 4.0
please see L<RT::Extension::ArticleTemplates>.

When this extension is installed RTFM parses content of articles as
a template using L<Text::Template> module. Using this extension you can
make your articles dynamic. L<Text::Template> module is used to parse
RT's Templates as well and its syntax is pretty simple - you can consult
RT docs/wiki or module's documentation.

=head1 VERY IMPORTANT

It's a B<SECURITY RISK> to install this extension on systems where
articles can be changed by not trusted users. You're warned!

Your articles may contain some text that looks like a template and
will be parsed after installation when it's actually is not valid
template.
