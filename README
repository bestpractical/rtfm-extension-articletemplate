NAME
    RTFM::Extension::ArticleTemplates - turns articles into dynamic
    templates.

DESCRIPTION
    This extension works with RT 3.8 and RTFM. If you are using RT 4.0
    please see RT::Extension::ArticleTemplates.

    When this extension is installed RTFM parses content of articles as a
    template using Text::Template module. Using this extension you can make
    your articles dynamic. Text::Template module is used to parse RT's
    Templates as well and its syntax is pretty simple - you can consult RT
    docs/wiki or module's documentation.

VERY IMPORTANT
    It's a SECURITY RISK to install this extension on systems where articles
    can be changed by not trusted users. You're warned!

    Your articles may contain some text that looks like a template and will
    be parsed after installation when it's actually is not valid template.

    This extension requires RTFM 2.2.2.
